<ul class="bulletList"><li>Violent clashes are continuing in Cairo as supporters of the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak, lay siege to Tahrir Square, where thousands of anti-government protesters have been demanding he step down immediately.</li>
<li>The two sides have been throwing stones and petrol bombs at each other, and fighting with sticks and iron bars. Officials say three people were killed and more than 600 injured.</li>
<li>The leading opposition figure, Mohamed ElBaradei, has condemned the attacks on protesters as a criminal act by a criminal regime. He is reported to have called on the army to intervene.</li>
<li>The White House has deplored the violence and called for restraint. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said attacks on peaceful demonstrators are unacceptable.</li>
<li>The army has called on all protesters to return home and allow Egypt to return to normal.</li>

<p><strong>0035</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Matthew Price says that from Israel&rsquo;s perspective it has signed two important peace treaties in the region &ndash; one with Egypt and one with Jordan. A senior Jordanian official has told him that if Egypt slides into chaos, its 32-year-old peace treaty with Israel might not last long &ndash; and that would put Jordan under immense pressure to look again at its own peace treaty. Both Israel and Jordan are watching nervously what happens in Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>0027</strong> The BBC&rsquo;s Matthew Price in Amman reports that while most Jordanians are not seeking the overthrow of their country&rsquo;s king, the elites of the country are still worried about &ldquo;the destabilising effect of an Egypt in chaos&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>0025</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Katty Kay notes that one important form of leverage that the US has at its disposal is the enormous amount of aid it grants to Egypt. But, she says, when you ask the White House how long it will take to review the aid budget, aides there don&rsquo;t know. It could take weeks, while the situation in Cairo is changing by the hour.</p>
<p><strong>0022</strong>Brian Katulis of the Center for American Progress tells the BBC&rsquo;s Matt Frei that most of what the US is doing on Egypt is happening behind the scenes. He says there is an &ldquo;aggressive diplomatic surge&rdquo; to push Egypt&rsquo;s rulers to the next stage: a negotiation over power. That looks to be a complicated political negoitation involving a diverse array of opposition figures. Mr Katulis says we should not forget the real fragility of the situation: this is a country that has suffered before at the hands of Islamic extremists.</p>
<p><strong>0019</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Katty Kay says that despite extensive aid and incredibly close military ties, the Obama administration does not seem to be able to say to President Mubarak that he must leave now and make the transition peaceful. He is digging in his heels. The army wants to make sure that there is stability but in such a way that it benefits the army. But if there are genuine free and fair elections, the army will lose some of its power.</p>
<p><strong>0015</strong> Dr Essam el-Erian, a spokesman for the Islamist opposition movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, tells the BBC: &ldquo;Nobody in Egypt can trust this promise. Mr Mubarak, staying in power for 30 years, made many promises and did not fulfil them at all. He promised that we could have a free and fair election. All the world knows that [last] election was rigged. And he&rsquo;s still saying that election was good.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>2339</strong>Senior Obama adviser David Axelrod tells the Huffington Post: &ldquo;I think that every situation of this sort requires a thoughtful response.

<p><strong>2334</strong>Khaled Kamal, a doctor in Cairo, tells the BBC: &ldquo;The pro-Mubarak protesters were the usual regime mercenaries that we used to see each time they want to end the peaceful protests.

Now we don&rsquo;t know if we should continue or stop because of the potential for violence. At the same time we don&rsquo;t want to lose what we achieved in the last few days. If the opposition groups don&rsquo;t find a solution we will march again on Friday, maybe on the presidential palace. But the real question is what will happen in Tahrir Square tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>2328</strong>Muhamed Tamamy, an Egyptian doctor who is in Tahrir Square, tells the BBC: &ldquo;The situation here in the square is better than it was this morning but there&rsquo;s still a big confrontation going on between the two sides. The thugs thought they&rsquo;d scare us when they came into the square, but they&rsquo;d made us more determined. The people in the square fought back and gained confidence as they drove them out of the square. When we catch them, they tell us they took money to come and fight. We don&rsquo;t know where they came from or who paid them. Anyone who says they are for Mubarak in the square now risks being severely beaten, even to death. After the speech yesterday lots of people went home, saying they would come back if Mubarak didn&rsquo;t do as he promised. I wanted to leave but after today, I am determined to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2324</strong>Senator McCain continues: &ldquo;I remain concerned about the role of the Muslim Brotherhood and other organizations in Egypt that espouse an extremist ideology. But Egypt must have a democratic future. It is the will of the Egyptian people. It is in the interest of the United States. And the greatest contribution that President Mubarak can make to the cause of democracy in his country is to remove himself from power.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2322</strong>US Senator John McCain has just released this statement: &ldquo;The rapidly deteriorating situation in Egypt leads me to the conclusion that President Mubarak needs to step down and relinquish power. It is clear that the only institution in Egypt that can restore order is the army, but I fear that for it to do so on behalf of a government led by or involving President Mubarak would only escalate the violence and compromise the army&rsquo;s legitimacy. I urge President Mubarak to transfer power to a caretaker administration that includes members of Egypt&rsquo;s military, government, civil society, and pro-democracy opposition, which can lead the country to free, fair, and internationally credible elections this year as part of a real transition to democracy.</p>
<p><strong>2318</strong> World Bank President Robert Zoellick tells Reuters that the world&rsquo;s development agencies must be prepared to act quickly to help the people of Egypt. He says countries like Egypt are hampered by &ldquo;partial modernization&rdquo; where, despite the nation&rsquo;s economic advances, the political system prevents the majority of people from accessing wealth.</p>

<p>notes that: &ldquo;Special envoy to Egypt Frank Wisner is returning from Cairo, with an administration official saying he was no longer able to be as effective a conduit to President Mubarak after their private conversations had been made public. Wisner, the former Ambassador to Egypt during the Reagan and Bush Sr administrations, was sent to Cairo on Sunday at the suggestion of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton because of his close relationship with Mubarak. But their back-channel conversations became no longer useful, an administration official said, after they found their way into the media.&rdquo;<br><!-- S IIMA --></p>

<p><strong>2258</strong>World Bank President Robert Zoellick says the situation in the Middle East is &ldquo;fragile&rdquo;. &ldquo;It is extremely difficult at this point to read exactly what will happen,&rdquo; he says, adding that implementing economic and social reforms &ldquo;in a midst of a revolution is a tricky prospect&rdquo;. &ldquo;We are certainly on high alert in terms of being able to stay in close touch and see what we can try to do to alleviate the problems, and as they go through the appropriate transitions if they move to reform systems how we can try to support it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2252</strong>Roger Hardy, a Middle East analyst at the Woodrow Wilson Center, tells the BBC: &ldquo;It does look to me now that the government&rsquo;s rather Machiavellian strategy was to lull the protesters into a false sense of security in Tahrir Square, where there was a carnival atmosphere. And now their very rude message is: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all over. Now go home. And by the way, if you don&rsquo;t, we won&rsquo;t start negotiations.&rsquo; The role of the army is becoming less and less ambiguous. It is moving away from the protesters and closer to the regime. The next few days are crucial. This could get uglier before we get anything like a resolution. This may sound a little stark, but I feel that Tahrir Square could become and Arab Tiananmen Square.&rdquo;</p>

<p>tweets: &ldquo;People, Tahrir square is again secured at the time being. It will be a long night,&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2239</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Andrew North in Washington says: &ldquo;I have been talking to a number of diplomats here and they are saying that all the evidence is pointing towards state-sponsorship of the violence in Cairo. There possibly was some genuine pro-Mubarak support on the streets as well, but they say they have proof that elements linked to the government were behind it. But the Western powers do not yet want to directly accuse the president and his supporters.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2235</strong>Sallie Pisch of the English-language Egyptian news website, Bikya Masr, tells the BBC: &ldquo;I absolutely believe that the pro-Mubarak demonstrators are being co-ordinated. From conversations that I&rsquo;ve had with people, and from previous experience of demonstrations in Egypt, it is very clear that the government is trying to make a statement that people must choose between security and freedom. Many of the people who started the violence were paid by the government. Several sources told me that many of those arrested today were carrying police IDs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2229</strong>Nabil Ali Mas, a doctor who has been treating some of those hurt in the violence, tells the BBC: &ldquo;I saw many injured people, from 300 to 400, at least &ndash; all kinds of injuries you can find. But I didn&rsquo;t see any injuries from guns. What I saw was from sharp objects, and there are a lot of fractures, and some people lost their eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2224</strong>Maggie Leon Marga, who lives in a street very close to Tahrir Square, tells the BBC: &ldquo;Every time the protesters try to escape from the square, they come and hide in our street. They keep throwing stones and Molotov cocktails, which are causing fires to break out in our buildings. We are trying to quench the fires from our balconies. The situation has been terrifying for the past nine days, but today is the worst of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2219</strong>The Egyptian-British novelist Ahdaf Soueif tells the BBC: &ldquo;This movement is being led by groups of young people. They have no reason whatsoever to believe any promises that President Mubarak or his regime make. They&rsquo;ve really gone far too far. There&rsquo;s a call for another massive protest on Friday. We&rsquo;ll see what happens in Tahrir Square tonight. I&rsquo;ve left my nieces and my son and their friends in the square and they are refusing to leave. It&rsquo;s important to note that this is pro-democracy, open, modern, young, secular &ndash; everything that the world should be supporting.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2208</strong>Mr Badrawi, who has called for reform in the past, also says he &ldquo;salutes&rdquo; the protesters, because they have achieved what he could not. &ldquo;I agree with the protesters about reform. What I don&rsquo;t agree with is creating a political or constitutional vacuum,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We have to read the constitution. We have to respect the constitution. We have to amend certain articles in order to have new authorities in place governed by a constitution that represents what the protesters have demanded. The constitution says that if the president passes his powers to the vice-president, he will be able to do everything except amend the constitution, dissolve parliament, or dismiss the government. Now, we have an excellent chance with President Mubarak&rsquo;s proposals, to make the amendments and then discuss when he should step down.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2204</strong>Hossam Badrawi, a leading member of the ruling National Democratic Party, denies that it has organised the attacks by supporters of the government on the opposition protesters. &ldquo;Look at who the beneficiaries are. The protesters have won,&rdquo; he tells the BBC. &ldquo;If there is any proof of this, it is not acceptable and should be investigated.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2203</strong> A doctor at a clinic near Tahrir Square tells the Reuters news agency that more than 1,500 people have been injured so far in Wednesday&rsquo;s violence &ndash; nearly three times the official figure.</p>
<p><strong>2146</strong>Mr Farid says at least 611 people have been injured in the clashes.</p>
<p><strong>2143</strong>Health Minister Ahmed Samih Farid also tells the Associated Press that three people have died. Two young men were brought out of Tahrir Square in ambulances, one already dead and another who later died at a hospital, he says. It is not clear if they were government supporters or opposition protesters. The third fatality was a man who fell from a bridge near the square, Mr Farid says. He was wearing civilian clothes, but may have been a member of the security forces, he adds.</p>
<p><strong>2136</strong>Al-Arabiya quotes the Egyptian health minister as saying that three people have been killed in the violence in Cairo on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>2128</strong>President Mubarak&rsquo;s son, Gamal, is not in London as has been reported, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague tells the BBC. &ldquo;I have spoken to&hellip; Gamal on the telephone and said if it turns out that there was state-sponsored violence [in Cairo], that would be catastrophic for Egypt and for those who are in government now,&rdquo; he adds. Gamal Mubarak had been considered a likely to successor to his elderly father until the recent unrest.</p>
<p><strong>2120</strong>The Committee to Protect Journalists has accused the Egyptian government of using &ldquo;blanket censorship, intimidation, and today a series of deliberate attacks on journalists carried out by pro-government mobs&rdquo; to deprive the world of independent information about the unrest. Reporters Without Borders, meanwhile, has said &ldquo;infiltrated policemen&rdquo; joined the assaults. The Egyptian government has denied the allegations.</p>
<p><strong>2116</strong>Referring to the pro-government demonstrators, a senior US official tells the Reuters news agency that it is clear that &ldquo;somebody loyal to Mubarak has unleashed these guys to try to intimidate the protesters&rdquo;.</p>

From time to time you also hear quick bursts of gunfire, and see tracer rounds fly from one side of the square to the other. I suspect that is coming from soldiers, who are probably trying to dissuade people from coming too close or climbing on their tanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>1914</strong>An eyewitness of the clashes in Tahrir Square, who identified himself only as Motaz, tells the BBC he has seen a variety of injuries sustained by those in the square: &ldquo;Mostly injuries on people&rsquo;s heads, rock-throwing injuries. A few people seem to have received either heavy blows or rocks to their upper body or their arms, that is what we have seen so far. I have seen a few people being carried on stretchers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1904</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Rupert Wingfield-Hayes says: &ldquo;Heliopolis is not like the rest of Cairo. It has grand houses and leafy boulevards. Here the police are still welcomed on the streets. This is the home of Egypt&rsquo;s ruling elite &ndash; people like Dr Magid Boutros &ndash; a close adviser to Mr Mubarak. He says the president is now determined to stand and fight: &lsquo;He&rsquo;s an army man. Military commanders, if they abandon their posts, they are shot.&rsquo; Outside on the street I was confronted by members of Egypt&rsquo;s ruling class &ndash; educated, articulate and angry. As we returned from Heliopolis our car was forced of the road by another group of angry men. They handed us over to the dreaded Mukhabarat &ndash; the secret police in their brown leather jackets. We were handcuffed and blindfolded and taken to an interrogation cell. Three hours later we were released onto a remote backstreet. The regime is hardening its attitude to the protestors and to the foreign media. Egypt&rsquo;s ruling class is fighting back.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1900</strong>A close adviser to President Hosni Mubarak has told the BBC that the president is determined to &ldquo;tough it out&rdquo;, and will not give in to demands that he step down immediately. He was speaking to our correspondent, Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, who went to the wealthy Cairo suburb of Heliopolis to meet him &ndash; and was then detained by Egypt&rsquo;s secret police.</p>

<p><strong>1850</strong>The White House Correspondents&rsquo; Association has criticised US President Barack Obama for providing too little information and access to the media during the crisis in Egypt. &ldquo;Prior to the president&rsquo;s statement Tuesday night, the press corps had not received a substantive update from the White House all day on the situation in Egypt,&rdquo; a letter says. &ldquo;In addition, the press corps did not have an on-camera briefing, or an off-camera gaggle, with you yesterday to ask the White House about its decision-making process during this major foreign policy crisis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Obama&rsquo;s strength has also been his profound weakness vis-a-vis Egypt. He has been cautious to a fault. Consequently, he and his administration have consistently been behind the curve, surprised by events, and caught flatfooted by the trajectory of history.&rdquo;</p>

But after thousands of anti-government protesters gathered in the main square on Tuesday, it still has the feel of a city where most want the president to step down immediately. Perhaps emboldened by the scenes in Tahrir Square, small groups of pro-government demonstrators have been out on the streets, interestingly supported by police vehicles.

<p><strong>1706</strong>BBC world affairs editor John Simpson, in Tahrir Square, says: &ldquo;The stand-off in Tahrir Square seems to be approaching a critical moment. Pro-Mubarak groups, determined and aggressive, have been pushing their way to the edges of Tahrir Square all afternoon. Soldiers, controlling the entrances to the square, have mostly stopped them going further in. But fights have been breaking out and large numbers of missiles &ndash; bricks, stones and bits of ironwork, have been flying through the air on both sides. There are too few soldiers here to keep any kind of order. The most they can do is prevent the big numbers of Mubarak loyalists from getting into the square, bottling them up into huge groups on the edges. The net effect of the arrival in force of groups of Mubarak supporters seems to have been to strengthen the resolve of the hard-line demonstrators to stay inside the square. The gradual drift away from the square seems to have stopped. For now, it is the only place where the demonstrators can feel more or less safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1702</strong>Azza, one of the anti-government protesters in Tahrir Square, tells the BBC that she has seen many injured people. &ldquo;Lots of people are covered in blood. Lots of people [have broken bones]. They are throwing lots of big, big, big stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>that it is the &ldquo;most remarkable regional uprising&rdquo; he can remember, adding: &ldquo;The US has an overwhelmingly powerful role there. Egypt is the second largest recipient of US military and economic aid. Obama himself has been highly supportive of Mubarak&hellip; This is one of the most brutal dictators of the region.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1656</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Magdi Abdelhadi in Cairo says: &ldquo;It is virtually impossible to know the extent of support for Mr Mubarak in Egyptian society. Throughout his long time in office there have never been free and fair elections by international standards and opinion polls designed to measure the president&rsquo;s popularity are banned. This leaves most people with guesstimates. There is no doubt, however, that there is a genuine Mubarak constituency &ndash; those who stand to lose influence or money. What complicates the picture further is that there is a tradition of paying the poor and the not so politically aware to come out and demonstrate or vote. There is also what you may call the emotional constituency &ndash; equally difficult to quantify. In a conservative patriarchal culture like Egypt, there will be those who see Mr Mubarak as a father figure and will mourn his demise. One young man told me it was unacceptable to humiliate a man of his age, let alone the father of a nation.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>1635</strong> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tells his country&rsquo;s parliament that the unrest in Egypt could destabilise the Middle East &ldquo;for many years&rdquo;, and spark a battle between democrats and radical Islamists. &ldquo;There are two worlds, two halves, two views &ndash; that of the free world and that of the radical world,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Which one will prevail in Egypt? The answer is crucial to the future of Egypt, the future of the region, and for us here in Israel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>1629</strong>Medical officials tell the AFP news agency that at least 500 people have been wounded in the clashes in central Cairo.</p>
<p><strong>1626</strong>A CNN correspondent reports that the petrol bombs are being thrown by supporters of President Mubarak at the anti-government protesters.</p>
<p><strong>1624</strong>Opposition protester Gigi Ibrahim tells the BBC she is trapped in Tahrir Square, and fears violence if she tries to leave: &ldquo;The situation is escalating by the minute. If we want to get out we have to go through Mubarak supporters. I&rsquo;m scared of going out because my face is now recognisable as an opposition protester.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1621</strong>In an interview with BBC Arabic, Egypt&rsquo;s new Finance Minister, Samir Radwan, calls for the opposition to accept the offer of dialogue with the government. &ldquo;They are afraid to sit and talk because it will appear that they do not have an economics of foreign affairs programme,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But we must sit together in order to avoid any chaos.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1616</strong>Soldiers are using hoses to douse the flames caused by the petrol-bomb explosions, AFP reports.</p>
<p><strong>1614</strong>CNN is broadcasting pictures of the stand-off near the back of the Egyptian Museum. There is a small fire in the street, and another in a building opposite. But there is no indication that there is a fire inside the world-famous institution, which was damaged by looters on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>1610</strong>Two petrol bombs have landed inside the grounds of the Egyptian Museum, near where pro- and anti-government demonstrators have been involved in violent clashes, according to the AFP news agency.</p>
<p><strong>1604</strong>Witnesses tell BBC Arabic that the camels and horses that charged anti-government demonstrators in Tahrir Square earlier belonged to people who work at the Pyramids in Giza. They were apparently angry that the unrest was driving away tourists from Cairo and hurting their businesses.</p>

<p><strong>1536</strong>Mubarak supporters are dropping concrete blocks on opposition protesters from roofs, AFP reports.</p>
<p><strong>1534</strong>BBC world affairs editor John Simpson, in Tahrir Square, says: &ldquo;I am among a group of Mubarak supporters. They have been preparing all sorts of weapons &ndash; pulling down iron railings, breaking up paving stones &ndash; and using them against anti-government protesters. There has been a kind of counter-attack by the pro-Mubarak groups, who are determined to force the remaining protesters out of the square. The soldiers are right here, sitting on their tanks, looking on and occasionally taking shelter, but are not trying to intervene. People know the army is not going to fire on either side, so their presence is not intimidating. The Mubarak supporters are forcing their way into the square through all the main entrances, and trying to force out the protesters gathered there.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1524</strong>Ibrahim Zadran, co-ordinator of the opposition National Association for Change and an ally of Mohamed ElBaradei, tells the BBC: &ldquo;We are asking the army to defend us.

<p>tweets: &ldquo;More and more pro-Mubarak ppl are heading to Tahrir. Why did the army let them in?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1314</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Jeremy Bowen in Cairo says: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of violence. People are badly bloodied. They are saying they&rsquo;ve been taken prisoner. I&rsquo;ve seen people with some real nasty wounds. It&rsquo;s an ugly ugly atmosphere. The army are standing by watching.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1312</strong>Reuters reports that the men on horses and camels are Mubarak supporters who charged on opposition protesters, wielding sticks and whips.</p>
<p><strong>1309</strong>Men on horses and camels have entered Tahrir Square in Cairo, as clashes again break out in Tahrir Square.</p>
<p><strong>1302</strong>Latest pictures from Tahrir Square appear to show violence has now subsided.</p>
<p><strong>1300</strong>Egyptian journalist Nadia el-Awaddy, at Tahrir Square, tells the BBC that tear gas was used during clashes between rival sets of protesters.</p>
<p><strong>1258</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s security correspondent Frank Gardner says: &ldquo;A few days ago it looked like Hosni Mubarak was going to be the next Arab leader driven out of office. This no longer looks to be the case. This is going to be taken in by other Arab leaders, who are recalibrating their responses. So this is not quite the spectacular revolution the protesters were hoping for.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1257</strong>British officials say nationals wanting to leave Egypt will have to pay &pound;300 for a seat on one of the charter flights laid on by the government.</p>
<p><strong>1251</strong>Dubai&rsquo;s al-Arabiya TV says pro-Mubarak protesters have assaulted one of their reporting crews and destroyed their equipment.</p>
<p><strong>1249</strong>Reuters says the protesters involved in clashes in Tahrir Square were using stones and sticks, and about 10 people at the scene were wounded.</p>
<p><strong>1236</strong>More from the BBC&rsquo;s Jim Muir: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not clear how much violence is happening, but projectiles have been thrown. There is a huge potential for conflict. The army had previously succeeded in keeping Mubarak supporters away from the square, but the army lines appear to have been breeched.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1235</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Jim Muir in Tahrir Square confirms that clashes are going on between opposition protesters and pro-Mubarak groups.</p>
<p><strong>1231</strong>Al-Jazeera TV broadcasts pictures of running battles in Tahrir Square, backing up earlier AFP report (see 1227).</p>
<p><strong>1230</strong>A Mubarak supporter tell state-run Nile TV why she has joined a rally in support of the president: &ldquo;Please forgive me Mr President, I cried when I heard your speech. May God forgive them, We love you Mr President.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1227</strong>Opposition protesters tell AFP news agency that undercover police have stormed their protest in Tahrir Square.</p>
<p><strong>1225</strong>Egypt Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki defends Mr Mubarak&rsquo;s decision to hold on to power until September, telling the BBC: &ldquo;There is a keenness to avoid any constitutional anarchy if any president leaves office before the end of his mandate. He has to fulfil his mandate and follow the constitutional process.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1221</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Lina Sinjab reports from Yemen that the opposition there do not appear satisfied with President Saleh&rsquo;s announcement that he won&rsquo;t run again in 2013. They want to see concrete reforms delivered on the ground, she says.</p>
<p><strong>1218</strong>Catching up with some more international reaction to President Mubarak&rsquo;s announcement that he&rsquo;ll only step down after elections in September. British Prime Minister David Cameron says transition must be &ldquo;rapid and credible and needs to start now&rdquo;. Germany&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also called for a rapid transition, welcoming the opening to a &ldquo;new political beginning&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>1203</strong>From the BBC&rsquo;s Ian Pannell in Cairo: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just heard that thousands of supporters of President Mubarak have started surging into Tahrir Square in Cairo, dismantling barricades set up by anti-Mubarak protesters. Arguments and fist fights have broken out, and the situation is very tense.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1156</strong>The Associated Press reports pro-and anti-Mubarak groups clashing in Tahrir Square, hitting each other with sticks. Some were injured with their heads bleeding, the report says.</p>

<p><strong>1149</strong>One of the BBC&rsquo;s Arabic TV reporters says pro-Mubarak protestors have tried to march into Tahrir Square but the army forces stopped them. The anti-Mubarak protestors put barricades in the four major access points to the square and started searching the people for weapons and IDs.</p>

<p><strong>1139</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Magdi Abdelhadi reports from Cairo that the next battle will dismantling the regime, and this will prove easier said than done. Those with vested interests will defend themselves. Where the army stands in all this is crucial.</p>
<p><strong>1134</strong>From the BBC&rsquo;s Mark Georgiou in Cairo: &ldquo;Massive pro-Mubarak demo in Cairo. People very, very worked up, time and again we were told foreign media is not being fair and the people say that, now the president is not standing for election, it&rsquo;s time to restore order. Lots of anti-ElBaradei feeling. It&rsquo;s not as simple as just the people in Tahrir Square.</p>
<p><strong>1130</strong>The protesters, who represent a broad section of Egyptian society, would of course disagree with Mr Abdellah &ndash; as would the Muslim Brotherhood, the country&rsquo;s largest opposition movement. Many observers have pointed out that the protests in Tunisia, Egypt and beyond could be a hugely positive development for the Arab world, leading to greater freedom and democracy.</p>
<p><strong>1127</strong>Mr Abdellah also had this stark warning for the West: &ldquo;You in the West will be the first to pay the price if Egypt falls into the hands of Islamic extremists &ndash; you will pay the price! You will be the first to pay the price! Peace and stability in the Middle East will blow up!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1126</strong>Mohamed Abdellah, former head of the Egyptian parliament&rsquo;s foreign affairs committee and now president of Alexandria University, has given the BBC World Service this stinging attack on anti-Mubarak protesters. &ldquo;Those people wanted to go to Luxor and to go to the Cairo museum and destroy it. Do you believe that they are peaceful protesters? When you go into hospitals, to destroy hospitals; those are looters!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>1119</strong>Egyptian political analyst Mamoun Fandy tells BBC News Channel that the army is protecting both the protesters and President Mubarak&rsquo;s regime. It has called on people to go home, but is not ordering them to do so. At the same time, the army doesn&rsquo;t want to break the backbone of the Egyptian state by having even bigger protests, like the one called for Friday.</p>
<p><strong>1114</strong> Wyre Davies also reports that there are long queues at banks in Alexandria as people try to withdraw money, as well as huge lines for petrol and basic goods.</p>
<p><strong>1109</strong> In Alexandria, Egypt&rsquo;s second city, the BBC&rsquo;s Wyre Davies reports that tension is rising. Some pro-Mubarak demonstrators are on the streets, with many thinking the president has now done enough to satisfy the protesters. They have been out in small groups shouting that enough damage has been done to Egypt&rsquo;s reputation, and that anti-government protesters should go home.</p>
<p><strong>1057</strong>A fuller quote from that army statement earlier: &ldquo;We have to look forward to the future. We have to think about our country, Egypt. The army and the people overcame defeat in October 1973, the army and the people can change the current situation through chivalry, determination and courage. You message was delivered. Your demands are now known, and we are vigilant to keep the country secure for your sake, honourable Egyptians. We have to heed our country&rsquo;s call through hard and fruitful work. We have to deny the haters the sight of us in the midst of crises.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>1040</strong>Egypt&rsquo;s parliament speaker says the constitutional reforms promised by President Hosni Mubarak will be completed in less than two-and-a-half months, Reuters reports.</p>
<p><strong>1030</strong>Egypt&rsquo;s parliament will be suspended until revised results of the last elections are published, AFP reports.</p>
<p><strong>1026</strong>More on evacuations: Qantas will provide free flights home for Australians in Egypt. The federal government has chartered two planes to fly about 600 people to Frankfurt or London. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce says the airline will then provide Australians with free flights from Europe.</p>
<p><strong>1023</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Jennifer Pak in Kuala Lumpur says Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has ordered the evacuation of Malaysian students from Egypt. Three military aircraft will take off today to fly students to Saudi Arabia. There are about 11,000 Malaysian students registered with the Malaysian Embassy in Egypt.</p>

<p><strong>0958</strong>Food analyst Vincent Truglia has told BBC World Service he believes food shortages have been playing a significant role in Egypt&rsquo;s unrest. &ldquo;I believe that food and anxiety about food has been the key problem that has been facing Egypt. Food prices, specifically wheat in particular, which is the staple of the Egyptian diet, have gone up, depending on the measure, between 50 and 70% in 2010. This has just devastated Egyptian budgets.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>0921</strong>BBC World Affairs editor John Simpson says that if President Mubarak had made his offer just a few days ago, the reaction might have been rather different, but after shootings last friday the mood is much fiercer. People are saying that if a week of demonstrations has pushed the president this far then there&rsquo;s every incentive to keep up the pressure on him.</p>

<p><strong>0758</strong>President Saleh&rsquo;s term ends in 2013, so he has a bit more time to ease himself out of office than President Mubarak. Mr Saleh came to power in 1978, first as president of North Yemen and then, after unification with South Yemen in 1990, as leader of the newly united republic. He&rsquo;d already signalled in recent months that he might not stand again.</p>
<p><strong>0752</strong>Yemen is one of the countries that have seen demonstrations inspired by the &ldquo;Jasmine Revolution&rdquo; in Tunisia, which put an abrupt end to the rule of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali last month. Jordan and Algeria have also seen protests.</p>
<p><strong>0748</strong>Reuters are reporting that President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen says he won&rsquo;t seek to extend his presidential term or pass power to his son.</p>

<p><strong>0741</strong>Not all the demonstrators may have been appeased, but the secretary-general of the Egyptian-British chamber of commerce, Taher El Sherif, says President Mubarak is right to stay on. &ldquo;Really, I agree with President Mubarak that he should hand over the authority to his successors safely and in a more civilised way,&rdquo; he tells the BBC.</p>
<p><strong>0736</strong>But Jim Muir also reports that there were some quieter voices among those in Tahrir Square last night who were saying that this is the time to step back, accept Mr Mubarak&rsquo;s concessions, and allow for a smooth transition.</p>
<p><strong>0733</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Jim Muir in Cairo says up to 2,000 protesters spent the night in Tahrir Square &ndash; the epicentre of the protests. Among this hardcore of demonstrators prepared to brave the night time cold, there was a very strong view that President Mubarak had not gone far enough. They want to see him deposed and punished.</p>
<p><strong>0728</strong>And US President Obama responded to Mr Mubarak&rsquo;s speech by saying that any orderly transition must be meaningful, peaceful &ndash; and begin now.</p>
<p><strong>0727</strong>Let&rsquo;s remember that before the President Mubarak made his speech last night, the man who has emerged as Egypt&rsquo;s main opposition figure, Mohamed ElBaradei, demanded that Mr Mubarak step down by Friday at the latest.</p>
<p><strong>0725</strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Jon Leyne in Cairo says President Mubarak is gambling that enough ordinary Egyptians will accept his decision to stay on until the autumn elections. Mr Mubarak is said to have told a friend that he has a PhD in obstinacy, he says. But our correspondent adds that we should never underestimate the anger and impatience that has built up during the recent demonstrations.</p>

			<p>After two straight days of being attacked on the streets of Cairo, Anderson Cooper brought viewers his Thursday show from an undisclosed, dimly lit room, saying that he was &ldquo;a little bit scared&rdquo; for his safety.</p>
<p>Cooper was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/02/anderson-cooper-attacked-egypt-huff-post_n_817612.html" target="_hplink">punched repeatedly and attacked for minutes</a> by a mob of supporters of President Hosni Mubarak on Wednesday. On Thursday, another group of pro-government forces <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/03/anderson-cooper-car-attacked-egypt_n_818170.html" target="_hplink">smashed a rock through his car window</a> while he and his crew were in it. Cooper had been reporting from the Cairo streets, but by Thursday night he had gone to ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you where we are, frankly for our own safety,&rdquo; Cooper said. &ldquo;Systematically, we have seen journalists attacked&hellip;we would like to be showing you instead of&hellip;this strange image of us sitting on the floor of an undisclosed location in dim lighting, we would like to be showing you pictures, live pictures, of what&rsquo;s happening in Liberation Square right now, but we can&rsquo;t do that because our cameras have systematically been taken down through threats, through intimidation, through actual physical attacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you I am a little bit scared, because we frankly don&rsquo;t really know what the next few hours will hold. And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people who are scared tonight in Egypt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>              The asteroid Apophis was discovered on June 19, 2004. It will fly within 18,300 miles of Earth on April 13, 2029, but poses little risk of impact.<br><span>UH/IA</span></p>
<p>            </p>
<p>
	In 2004, NASA scientists announced that there was a chance that Apophis, an asteroid larger than two football fields, could smash into Earth in 2029. A few additional observations and some number-crunching later, astronomers noted that the chance of the planet-killer hitting Earth in 2029 was nearly zilch.</p>
<p>
	Now, reports out of Russia say that scientists there estimate Apophis will <a href="http://en.rian.ru/science/20110126/162318648.html">collide with Earth on April 13, 2036</a>. These reports conflict on the probability of such a doomsday event, but the question remains: How scared should we be?</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Technically, they&rsquo;re correct, there is a chance in 2036 [that Apophis will hit Earth],&rdquo; said Donald Yeomans, head of NASA&rsquo;s Near-Earth Object Program Office. However, that chance is just 1-in-250,000, Yeomans said.

	The Russian scientists are basing their predictions of a collision on the chance that the 900-foot-long (270 meters) Apophis will travel through what&rsquo;s called a gravitational keyhole as it passes by Earth in 2029. The gravitational keyhole they mention is a precise region in space, only slightly larger than the asteroid itself, in which the effect of Earth&rsquo;s gravity is such that it could tweak Apophis&rsquo; path.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The situation is that in 2029, April 13, [Apophis] flies very close to the Earth, within five Earth radii, so that will be quite an event, but we&rsquo;ve already ruled out the possibility of it hitting at that time,&rdquo; Yeomans told Life&rsquo;s Little Mysteries. &ldquo;On the other hand, if it goes through what we call a keyhole during that close Earth approach &hellip; then it will indeed be perturbed just right so that it will come back and smack Earth on April 13, 2036,&rdquo; Yeomans said.</p>
<p>
	The chances of the asteroid going through the keyhole, which is tiny compared to the asteroid, are &ldquo;minuscule,&rdquo; Yeomans added.</p>
<p>
	The more likely scenario is this: Apophis will make a fairly close approach to Earth in late 2012 and early 2013, and will be extensively observed with ground-based optical telescopes and radar systems. If it seems to be heading on a destructive path, NASA will devise the scheme and machinery necessary to change the asteroid&rsquo;s orbit, decreasing the probability of a collision in 2036 to zero, Yeomans said.</p>
<p>
	There are several ways to change an asteroid&rsquo;s orbit, the simplest of which is to <a href="http://www.space.com/7720-russia-attack-asteroid-virtually-threat.html">run a spacecraft into the hurtling rock</a>. This technology was used on July 4, 2005, when Deep Impact smashed into the comet Tempel 1.</p>

<p><!-- videoId: Ggzl8z9Csho --><img src="http://log.SunnyBoy.Me/wp-content/plugins/rss-poster/cache/3948c_340x_ggzl8z9csho.jpg" width="340" class="embeddedVideoThumbnail left image340" alt="Is This UFO Caught By Multiple Cameras a Real Alien Spaceship? (Updated)"><!-- /videoId: Ggzl8z9Csho --> I&rsquo;m <em>always</em> skeptical about little green men and their flying machines. There&rsquo;s always one nutter/hoaxer claiming to have captured an UFO on a blurry film. This time, however, it&rsquo;s hard to dismiss because multiple people caught it at the same time. <strong>Updated.</strong></p>
<p>The video above shows three videos taken from three different angles by three different people&mdash;including one woman from Mississippi&mdash;synchronized into one. Here&rsquo;s the first video, showing a bright dot descending and hovering over Jerusalem&rsquo;s Dome of the Rock, one of the holiest spots in the world, at the heart of the Jewish-Muslim conflict in Israel:</p>
<p><!-- videoId: r0lEqR1Oy3I --><img src="http://log.SunnyBoy.Me/wp-content/plugins/rss-poster/cache/3948c_340x_r0leqr1oy3i.jpg" width="340" class="embeddedVideoThumbnail left image340" alt="Is This UFO Caught By Multiple Cameras a Real Alien Spaceship? (Updated)"><!-- /videoId: r0lEqR1Oy3I --></p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s not very different from other blurry videos, except that this was simultaneously being filmed from different angles by other people around the city. That&rsquo;s the surprising fact. Here are more videos comparing the shots, with a close up of the American tourist&rsquo;s video:</p>
<p><!-- videoId: 6Xb9JoGyy98 --><img src="http://log.SunnyBoy.Me/wp-content/plugins/rss-poster/cache/3948c_340x_6xb9jogyy98.jpg" width="340" class="embeddedVideoThumbnail left image340" alt="Is This UFO Caught By Multiple Cameras a Real Alien Spaceship? (Updated)"><!-- /videoId: 6Xb9JoGyy98 --></p>
<p><!-- videoId: AXr8sWo5Ju4 --><img src="http://log.SunnyBoy.Me/wp-content/plugins/rss-poster/cache/3948c_340x_axr8swo5ju4.jpg" width="340" class="embeddedVideoThumbnail left image340" alt="Is This UFO Caught By Multiple Cameras a Real Alien Spaceship? (Updated)"><!-- /videoId: AXr8sWo5Ju4 --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that many people will claim some short of divine hand in all this, since this temple has a huge significance for the three dominant religions in the world. According to the Muslim version of the Lord of the Rings, the Dome of the Rock is the place where Muhammad ascended to heaven accompanied by the angel Gabriel. They also believe that Muhammad hanged around here with Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. The Jewish also believe that Abraham prepared Isaac for sacrifice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the hell this is, but that kind of behavior&mdash;hovering so close to a building and accelerating at blinding speed upwards&mdash;can&rsquo;t be replicated by any flying machine known to humans. Maybe it&rsquo;s all just a very elaborated conspiracy by multiple people from different nationalities and beliefs. Perhaps it is an awesome hoax by someone else&mdash;maybe a viral marketing campaign. Or maybe it&rsquo;s a secret Israeli military UAV. I&rsquo;m only certain of one thing: I can&rsquo;t wait for Bill O&rsquo;Reilly to tell us about how this was probably Jesus descending in his spaceship to check out if the tides were still working or not.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is this real or a hoax? And if it is real, what do you think it may be?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here&rsquo;s the fourth video that appears on the initial comparison.</p>
