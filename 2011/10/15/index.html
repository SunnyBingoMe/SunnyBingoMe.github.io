			<p><span class="date">ScienceDaily (Oct. 12, 2011)</span> &#151; New York University scientists have developed artificial structures that can self-replicate, a process that has the potential to yield new types of materials. In the natural world, self-replication is ubiquitous in all living entities, but artificial self-replication has been elusive. The new discovery is the first steps toward a general process for self-replication of a wide variety of arbitrarily designed seeds. The seeds are made from DNA tile motifs that serve as letters arranged to spell out a particular word. The replication process preserves the letter sequence and the shape of the seed and hence the information required to produce further generations.</p>
<p>The work, conducted by researchers in NYU&rsquo;s Departments of Chemistry and Physics and its Center for Soft Matter Research, appears in the latest issue of the journal <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>This process holds much promise for the creation of new materials. DNA is a robust functional entity that can organize itself and other molecules into complex structures. More recently DNA has been used to organize inorganic matter, such as metallic particles, as well. The re-creation by the NYU scientists of this type of assembly in a laboratory raises the prospect for the eventual development of self-replicating materials that possess a wide range of patterns and that can perform a variety of functions. The breakthrough the NYU researchers have achieved is the replication of a system that contains complex information. Thus, the replication of this material, like that of DNA in the cell, is not limited to repeating patterns.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this self-replication process, the NYU scientists created artificial DNA tile motifs &mdash; short, nanometer-scale arrangements of DNA. Each tile serves as a letter &mdash; A or B &mdash; that recognizes and binds to complementary letters A&rsquo; or B&rsquo;. In the natural world, the DNA replication process involves complementary matches between bases &mdash; adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T) and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C) &mdash; to form its familiar double helix. By contrast, the NYU researchers developed an artificial tile or motif, called BTX (bent triple helix molecules containing three DNA double helices), with each BTX molecule composed of 10 DNA strands. Unlike DNA, the BTX code is not limited to four letters &mdash; in principle, it can contain quadrillions of different letters and tiles that pair using the complementarity of four DNA single strands, or &ldquo;sticky ends,&rdquo; on each tile, to form a six-helix bundle.</p>
<p>In order to achieve self-replication of the BTX tile arrays, a seed word is needed to catalyze multiple generations of identical arrays. BTX&rsquo;s seed consists of a sequence of seven tiles &mdash; a seven-letter word. To bring about the self-replication process, the seed is placed in a chemical solution, where it assembles complementary tiles to form a &ldquo;daughter BTX array&rdquo; &mdash; a complementary word. The daughter array is then separated from the seed by heating the solution to ~ 40 oC. The process is then repeated. The daughter array binds with its complementary tiles to form a &ldquo;granddaughter array,&rdquo; thus achieving self-replication of the material and of the information in the seed &mdash; and hence reproducing the sequence within the original seed word. Significantly, this process is distinct from the replication processes that occur within the cell, because no biological components, particularly enzymes, are used in its execution &mdash; even the DNA is synthetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first step in the process of creating artificial self-replicating materials of an arbitrary composition,&rdquo; said Paul Chaikin, a professor in NYU&rsquo;s Department of Physics and one of the study&rsquo;s co-authors. &ldquo;The next challenge is to create a process in which self-replication occurs not only for a few generations, but long enough to show exponential growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While our replication method requires multiple chemical and thermal processing cycles, we have demonstrated that it is possible to replicate not just molecules like cellular DNA or RNA, but discrete structures that could in principle assume many different shapes, have many different functional features, and be associated with many different types of chemical species,&rdquo; added Nadrian Seeman, a professor in NYU&rsquo;s Department of Chemistry and a co-author of the study.</p>
<p>The research was supported by grants from the W.M. Keck Foundation, the MRSEC Program of the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the Army Research Office, NASA, and the Office of Naval Research.</p>

<p><strong>(WIRED)</strong> &mdash; The tributes to Dennis Ritchie won&rsquo;t match the river of praise that spilled out over the web after the death of Steve Jobs. But they should.</p>
<p>And then some.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Steve Jobs died last week, there was a huge outcry, and that was very moving and justified. But Dennis had a bigger effect, and the public doesn&rsquo;t even know who he is,&rdquo; says Rob Pike, the programming legend and current Googler who spent 20 years working across the hall from Ritchie at the famed Bell Labs.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, with a <a href="http://https//plus.google.com/u/2/101960720994009339267/posts/ENuEDDYfvKP?hl=en" target="_blank">post to Google+</a>, Pike announced that Ritchie had died at his home in New Jersey over the weekend after a long illness, and though the response from hardcore techies was immense, the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/13/dennis_ritchie_obituary/" target="_blank">collective eulogy</a> from the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-20119811-92/dennis-ritchie-father-of-c-programming-language-dies/?tag=mncol" target="_blank">web at large</a> doesn&rsquo;t quite do justice to Ritchie&rsquo;s sweeping influence on the modern world.</p>
<p>Dennis Ritchie is the father of the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/tag/c-programming-language/" target="_blank">C programming language</a>, and with fellow Bell Labs researcher Ken Thompson, he used C to build UNIX, the operating system that so much of the world is built on &mdash; including the Apple empire overseen by Steve Jobs.</p>
<p><a href="http://geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2011/10/13/without-dennis-ritchie-you-might-not-be-reading-this/">CNN&rsquo;s GeekOut blog: Without Ritchie, you wouldn&rsquo;t be reading this</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty much everything on the web uses those two things: C and UNIX,&rdquo; Pike tells Wired. &ldquo;The browsers are written in C. The UNIX kernel &mdash; that pretty much the entire Internet runs on &mdash; is written in C. Web servers are written in C, and if they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re written in Java or C++, which are C derivatives, or Python or Ruby, which are implemented in C. And all of the network hardware running these programs I can almost guarantee were written in C.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really hard to overstate how much of the modern information economy is built on the work Dennis did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Windows was once written in C, he adds, and UNIX underpins both Mac OS X, Apple&rsquo;s desktop operating system, and iOS, which runs the iPhone and the iPad. &ldquo;Jobs was the king of the visible, and Ritchie is the king of what is largely invisible,&rdquo; says Martin Rinard, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/tag/steve-jobs/" target="_blank">Jobs</a>&lsquo; genius is that he builds these products that people really like to use because he has taste and can build things that people really find compelling. <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/tag/dennis-ritchie/" target="_blank">Ritchie</a> built things that technologists were able to use to build core infrastructure that people don&rsquo;t necessarily see much anymore, but they use everyday.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>From B to C</strong></p>
<p>Dennis Ritchie built C because he and Ken Thompson needed a better way to build UNIX. The original UNIX kernel was written in assembly language, but they soon decided they needed a &ldquo;higher level&rdquo; language, something that would give them more control over all the data that spanned the OS. Around 1970, they tried building a second version with Fortran, but this didn&rsquo;t quite cut it, and Ritchie proposed a new language based on a Thompson creation known as B.</p>
<p>Depending on which legend you believe, B was named either for Thompson&rsquo;s wife Bonnie or BCPL, a language developed at Cambridge in the mid-60s. Whatever the case, B begat <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/tag/c/" target="_blank">C</a>.</p>
<p>B was an interpreted language &mdash; meaning it was executed by an intermediate piece of software running atop a CPU &mdash; but C was a compiled language. It was translated into machine code, and then directly executed on the CPU. But in those days, C was considered a high-level language. It would give Ritchie and Thompson the flexibility they needed, but at the same time, it would be fast.</p>
<p>That first version of the language wasn&rsquo;t all that different from C as we know it today &mdash; though it was a tad simpler. It offered full data structures and &ldquo;types&rdquo; for defining variables, and this is what Richie and Thompson used to build their new UNIX kernel. &ldquo;They built C to write a program,&rdquo; says Pike, who would join Bell Labs 10 years later. &ldquo;And the program they wanted to write was the UNIX kernel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ritchie&rsquo;s running joke was that C had &ldquo;the power of assembly language and the convenience of &hellip; assembly language.&rdquo; In other words, he acknowledged that C was a less-than-gorgeous creation that still ran very close to the hardware. Today, it&rsquo;s considered a low-level language, not high. But Ritchie&rsquo;s joke didn&rsquo;t quite do justice to the new language. In offering true data structures, it operated at a level that was just high enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re writing a large program &mdash; and that&rsquo;s what UNIX was &mdash; you have to manage the interactions between all sorts of different components: all the users, the file system, the disks, the program execution, and in order to manage that effectively, you need to have a good representation of the information you&rsquo;re working with. That&rsquo;s what we call data structures,&rdquo; Pike says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To write a kernel without a data structure and have it be as consist and graceful as UNIX would have been a much, much harder challenge. They needed a way to group all that data together, and they didn&rsquo;t have that with Fortran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time, it was an unusual way to write an operating system, and this is what allowed Ritchie and Thompson to eventually imagine porting the OS to other platforms, which they did in the late 70s. &ldquo;That opened the floodgates for UNIX running everywhere,&rdquo; Pike says. &ldquo;It was all made possible by C.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Apple, Microsoft and beyond</strong></p>
<p>At the same time, C forged its own way in the world, moving from Bell Labs to the world&rsquo;s universities and to Microsoft, the breakout software company of the 1980s. &ldquo;The development of the C programming language was a huge step forward and was the right middle ground &hellip; C struck exactly the right balance, to let you write at a high level and be much more productive, but when you needed to, you could control exactly what happened,&rdquo; says Bill Dally, chief scientist of NVIDIA and Bell Professor of Engineering at Stanford. &ldquo;[It] set the tone for the way that programming was done for several decades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Pike points out, the data structures that Richie built into C eventually gave rise to the object-oriented paradigm used by modern languages such as C++ and Java.</p>
<p>The revolution began in 1973, when Ritchie published his research paper on the language, and five years later, he and colleague Brian Kernighan released the definitive C book: The C Programming Language. Kernighan had written the early tutorials for the language, and at some point, he &ldquo;twisted Dennis&rsquo; arm&rdquo; into writing a book with him.</p>
<p>Pike read the book while still an undergraduate at the University of Toronto, picking it up one afternoon while heading home for a sick day. &ldquo;That reference manual is a model of clarity and readability compared to latter manuals. It is justifiably a classic,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I read it while sick in bed, and it made me forget that I was sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like many university students, Pike had already started using the language. It had spread across college campuses because Bell Labs started giving away the UNIX source code. Among so many other things, the operating system gave rise to the modern open source movement. Pike isn&rsquo;t overstating it when says the influence of Ritchie&rsquo;s work can&rsquo;t be overstated, and though Ritchie received the Turing Award in 1983 and the National Medal of Technology in 1998, he still hasn&rsquo;t gotten his due.</p>
<p>As Kernighan and Pike describe him, Ritchie was an unusually private person. &ldquo;I worked across the hall from him for more than 20 years, and yet I feel like a don&rsquo;t knew him all that well,&rdquo; Pike says. But this doesn&rsquo;t quite explain his low profile. Steve Jobs was a private person, but his insistence on privacy only fueled the cult of personality that surrounded him.</p>
<p>Ritchie lived in a very different time and worked in a very different environment than someone like Jobs. It only makes sense that he wouldn&rsquo;t get his due.
