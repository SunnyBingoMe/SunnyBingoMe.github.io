<ul class="bulletList">
<li>Violent clashes are continuing in Cairo as supporters of the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak, lay siege to Tahrir Square, where thousands of anti-government protesters have been demanding he step down immediately.</li>
<li>The two sides have been throwing stones and petrol bombs at each other, and fighting with sticks and iron bars. Officials say three people were killed and more than 600 injured.</li>
<li>The leading opposition figure, Mohamed ElBaradei, has condemned the attacks on protesters as a criminal act by a criminal regime. He is reported to have called on the army to intervene.</li>
<li>The White House has deplored the violence and called for restraint. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said attacks on peaceful demonstrators are unacceptable.</li>
<li>The army has called on all protesters to return home and allow Egypt to return to normal.</li>

<p><strong>0035</strong>The BBC&#8217;s Matthew Price says that from Israel&#8217;s perspective it has signed two important peace treaties in the region &#8211; one with Egypt and one with Jordan. A senior Jordanian official has told him that if Egypt slides into chaos, its 32-year-old peace treaty with Israel might not last long &#8211; and that would put Jordan under immense pressure to look again at its own peace treaty. Both Israel and Jordan are watching nervously what happens in Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>0027</strong> The BBC&#8217;s Matthew Price in Amman reports that while most Jordanians are not seeking the overthrow of their country&#8217;s king, the elites of the country are still worried about &#8220;the destabilising effect of an Egypt in chaos&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>0025</strong>The BBC&#8217;s Katty Kay notes that one important form of leverage that the US has at its disposal is the enormous amount of aid it grants to Egypt. But, she says, when you ask the White House how long it will take to review the aid budget, aides there don&#8217;t know. It could take weeks, while the situation in Cairo is changing by the hour.</p>
<p><strong>0022</strong>Brian Katulis of the Center for American Progress tells the BBC&#8217;s Matt Frei that most of what the US is doing on Egypt is happening behind the scenes. He says there is an &#8220;aggressive diplomatic surge&#8221; to push Egypt&#8217;s rulers to the next stage: a negotiation over power. That looks to be a complicated political negoitation involving a diverse array of opposition figures. Mr Katulis says we should not forget the real fragility of the situation: this is a country that has suffered before at the hands of Islamic extremists.</p>
<p><strong>0019</strong>The BBC&#8217;s Katty Kay says that despite extensive aid and incredibly close military ties, the Obama administration does not seem to be able to say to President Mubarak that he must leave now and make the transition peaceful. He is digging in his heels. The army wants to make sure that there is stability but in such a way that it benefits the army. But if there are genuine free and fair elections, the army will lose some of its power.</p>
<p><strong>0015</strong> Dr Essam el-Erian, a spokesman for the Islamist opposition movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, tells the BBC: &#8220;Nobody in Egypt can trust this promise. Mr Mubarak, staying in power for 30 years, made many promises and did not fulfil them at all. He promised that we could have a free and fair election. All the world knows that [last] election was rigged. And he&#8217;s still saying that election was good.&#8221;</p>

The vigil was held in the Bab Touma neighborhood in old Damascus. The police beat those gathered and took some of them, including known activist Suheir Atassi, to the Bab Touma police station. Suheir has been released and is doing fine.&#8221;<br />

<p><strong>2339</strong>Senior Obama adviser David Axelrod tells the Huffington Post: &#8220;I think that every situation of this sort requires a thoughtful response. You want to respond in a way that&#8217;s thoughtful and constructive, and sometimes with foreign policy, the most constructive answer isn&#8217;t necessarily the most visceral or satisfying.&#8221;</p>

People are crying because they fear they have lost what we have built up over the last few days. We tried so hard to keep the protests peaceful. Now we don&#8217;t know if we should continue or stop because of the potential for violence. At the same time we don&#8217;t want to lose what we achieved in the last few days. If the opposition groups don&#8217;t find a solution we will march again on Friday, maybe on the presidential palace. But the real question is what will happen in Tahrir Square tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>2328</strong>Muhamed Tamamy, an Egyptian doctor who is in Tahrir Square, tells the BBC: &#8220;The situation here in the square is better than it was this morning but there&#8217;s still a big confrontation going on between the two sides. The thugs thought they&#8217;d scare us when they came into the square, but they&#8217;d made us more determined. The people in the square fought back and gained confidence as they drove them out of the square. When we catch them, they tell us they took money to come and fight. We don&#8217;t know where they came from or who paid them. Anyone who says they are for Mubarak in the square now risks being severely beaten, even to death. After the speech yesterday lots of people went home, saying they would come back if Mubarak didn&#8217;t do as he promised. I wanted to leave but after today, I am determined to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2324</strong>Senator McCain continues: &#8220;I remain concerned about the role of the Muslim Brotherhood and other organizations in Egypt that espouse an extremist ideology. But Egypt must have a democratic future. It is the will of the Egyptian people. It is in the interest of the United States. And the greatest contribution that President Mubarak can make to the cause of democracy in his country is to remove himself from power.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2322</strong>US Senator John McCain has just released this statement: &#8220;The rapidly deteriorating situation in Egypt leads me to the conclusion that President Mubarak needs to step down and relinquish power. It is clear that the only institution in Egypt that can restore order is the army, but I fear that for it to do so on behalf of a government led by or involving President Mubarak would only escalate the violence and compromise the army&#8217;s legitimacy. I urge President Mubarak to transfer power to a caretaker administration that includes members of Egypt&#8217;s military, government, civil society, and pro-democracy opposition, which can lead the country to free, fair, and internationally credible elections this year as part of a real transition to democracy.</p>
<p><strong>2318</strong> World Bank President Robert Zoellick tells Reuters that the world&#8217;s development agencies must be prepared to act quickly to help the people of Egypt. He says countries like Egypt are hampered by &#8220;partial modernization&#8221; where, despite the nation&#8217;s economic advances, the political system prevents the majority of people from accessing wealth.</p>

<p>notes that: &#8220;Special envoy to Egypt Frank Wisner is returning from Cairo, with an administration official saying he was no longer able to be as effective a conduit to President Mubarak after their private conversations had been made public. Wisner, the former Ambassador to Egypt during the Reagan and Bush Sr administrations, was sent to Cairo on Sunday at the suggestion of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton because of his close relationship with Mubarak. But their back-channel conversations became no longer useful, an administration official said, after they found their way into the media.&#8221;<br />

<p><strong>2258</strong>World Bank President Robert Zoellick says the situation in the Middle East is &#8220;fragile&#8221;. &#8220;It is extremely difficult at this point to read exactly what will happen,&#8221; he says, adding that implementing economic and social reforms &#8220;in a midst of a revolution is a tricky prospect&#8221;. &#8220;We are certainly on high alert in terms of being able to stay in close touch and see what we can try to do to alleviate the problems, and as they go through the appropriate transitions if they move to reform systems how we can try to support it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2252</strong>Roger Hardy, a Middle East analyst at the Woodrow Wilson Center, tells the BBC: &#8220;It does look to me now that the government&#8217;s rather Machiavellian strategy was to lull the protesters into a false sense of security in Tahrir Square, where there was a carnival atmosphere. And now their very rude message is: &#8216;That&#8217;s all over. Now go home. And by the way, if you don&#8217;t, we won&#8217;t start negotiations.&#8217; The role of the army is becoming less and less ambiguous. It is moving away from the protesters and closer to the regime. The next few days are crucial. This could get uglier before we get anything like a resolution. This may sound a little stark, but I feel that Tahrir Square could become and Arab Tiananmen Square.&#8221;</p>

<p>tweets: &#8220;People, Tahrir square is again secured at the time being. It will be a long night,&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2239</strong>The BBC&#8217;s Andrew North in Washington says: &#8220;I have been talking to a number of diplomats here and they are saying that all the evidence is pointing towards state-sponsorship of the violence in Cairo. There possibly was some genuine pro-Mubarak support on the streets as well, but they say they have proof that elements linked to the government were behind it. But the Western powers do not yet want to directly accuse the president and his supporters.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2235</strong>Sallie Pisch of the English-language Egyptian news website, Bikya Masr, tells the BBC: &#8220;I absolutely believe that the pro-Mubarak demonstrators are being co-ordinated. From conversations that I&#8217;ve had with people, and from previous experience of demonstrations in Egypt, it is very clear that the government is trying to make a statement that people must choose between security and freedom. Many of the people who started the violence were paid by the government. Several sources told me that many of those arrested today were carrying police IDs.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2229</strong>Nabil Ali Mas, a doctor who has been treating some of those hurt in the violence, tells the BBC: &#8220;I saw many injured people, from 300 to 400, at least &#8211; all kinds of injuries you can find. But I didn&#8217;t see any injuries from guns. What I saw was from sharp objects, and there are a lot of fractures, and some people lost their eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2224</strong>Maggie Leon Marga, who lives in a street very close to Tahrir Square, tells the BBC: &#8220;Every time the protesters try to escape from the square, they come and hide in our street. They keep throwing stones and Molotov cocktails, which are causing fires to break out in our buildings. We are trying to quench the fires from our balconies. The situation has been terrifying for the past nine days, but today is the worst of them.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2219</strong>The Egyptian-British novelist Ahdaf Soueif tells the BBC: &#8220;This movement is being led by groups of young people. They have no reason whatsoever to believe any promises that President Mubarak or his regime make. They&#8217;ve really gone far too far. There&#8217;s a call for another massive protest on Friday. We&#8217;ll see what happens in Tahrir Square tonight. I&#8217;ve left my nieces and my son and their friends in the square and they are refusing to leave. It&#8217;s important to note that this is pro-democracy, open, modern, young, secular &#8211; everything that the world should be supporting.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2208</strong>Mr Badrawi, who has called for reform in the past, also says he &#8220;salutes&#8221; the protesters, because they have achieved what he could not. &#8220;I agree with the protesters about reform. What I don&#8217;t agree with is creating a political or constitutional vacuum,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We have to read the constitution. We have to respect the constitution. We have to amend certain articles in order to have new authorities in place governed by a constitution that represents what the protesters have demanded. The constitution says that if the president passes his powers to the vice-president, he will be able to do everything except amend the constitution, dissolve parliament, or dismiss the government. Now, we have an excellent chance with President Mubarak&#8217;s proposals, to make the amendments and then discuss when he should step down.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2204</strong>Hossam Badrawi, a leading member of the ruling National Democratic Party, denies that it has organised the attacks by supporters of the government on the opposition protesters. &#8220;Look at who the beneficiaries are. The protesters have won,&#8221; he tells the BBC. &#8220;If there is any proof of this, it is not acceptable and should be investigated.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2203</strong> A doctor at a clinic near Tahrir Square tells the Reuters news agency that more than 1,500 people have been injured so far in Wednesday&#8217;s violence &#8211; nearly three times the official figure.</p>
<p><strong>2146</strong>Mr Farid says at least 611 people have been injured in the clashes.</p>
<p><strong>2143</strong>Health Minister Ahmed Samih Farid also tells the Associated Press that three people have died. Two young men were brought out of Tahrir Square in ambulances, one already dead and another who later died at a hospital, he says. It is not clear if they were government supporters or opposition protesters. The third fatality was a man who fell from a bridge near the square, Mr Farid says. He was wearing civilian clothes, but may have been a member of the security forces, he adds.</p>
<p><strong>2136</strong>Al-Arabiya quotes the Egyptian health minister as saying that three people have been killed in the violence in Cairo on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>2128</strong>President Mubarak&#8217;s son, Gamal, is not in London as has been reported, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague tells the BBC. &#8220;I have spoken to&#8230; Gamal on the telephone and said if it turns out that there was state-sponsored violence [in Cairo], that would be catastrophic for Egypt and for those who are in government now,&#8221; he adds. Gamal Mubarak had been considered a likely to successor to his elderly father until the recent unrest.</p>
<p><strong>2120</strong>The Committee to Protect Journalists has accused the Egyptian government of using &#8220;blanket censorship, intimidation, and today a series of deliberate attacks on journalists carried out by pro-government mobs&#8221; to deprive the world of independent information about the unrest. Reporters Without Borders, meanwhile, has said &#8220;infiltrated policemen&#8221; joined the assaults. The Egyptian government has denied the allegations.</p>
<p><strong>2116</strong>Referring to the pro-government demonstrators, a senior US official tells the Reuters news agency that it is clear that &#8220;somebody loyal to Mubarak has unleashed these guys to try to intimidate the protesters&#8221;.</p>

From where I am standing, I can see people throwing petrol bombs being thrown. From time to time you also hear quick bursts of gunfire, and see tracer rounds fly from one side of the square to the other. I suspect that is coming from soldiers, who are probably trying to dissuade people from coming too close or climbing on their tanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>earlier. &#8220;We were moving quickly and a bunch of guys who hit us were also on the move, a lot of it was sort of glancing blows,&#8221; he told the Reuters news agency. &#8220;There was some thought that maybe someone in the crowd recognised me, but I couldn&#8217;t know for sure,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I think anyone with a camera is under threat in that crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2027</strong>Human Rights Watch says it wants the Egyptian authorities to investigate claims by Palestinians who escaped the Abu Zaabal jail in Egypt last Friday that guards there killed some of the fleeing prisoners. It quotes Omar Shaath, who was held without charge for a year, as saying there were &#8220;quite a few dead and wounded&#8221; after snipers opened fire on the escapees. Another man says he saw 10 to 12 dead bodies.</p>
<p><strong>2020</strong>More from Egyptian Vice-President Omar Suleiman: He is quoted by the official Mena news agency as saying &#8220;the participants in these demonstrations have conveyed their message, both those demanding reform and those who came out in support of President Hosni Mubarak&#8221;. He urges &#8220;all citizens to return to their homes and abide by the curfew to boost the authorities&#8217; efforts in restoring calm and stability, and limit the damage and losses the demonstrations have caused Egypt since they erupted last week&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>2012</strong>CNN reports that there have been demonstrations by anti-government protesters and supporters of President Mubarak in Egypt&#8217;s second city of Alexandria. However, the rival groups have kept apart and not clashed, it says.</p>
<p><strong>2007</strong>Egyptian Health Minister Ahmed Samih Farid tells the official Mena news agency that 611 people have been injured in Wednesday&#8217;s violence. Earlier, the health ministry announced that one person had been killed as a result of the clashes between pro- and anti-government demonstrators in Cairo.</p>

<p><strong>1914</strong>An eyewitness of the clashes in Tahrir Square, who identified himself only as Motaz, tells the BBC he has seen a variety of injuries sustained by those in the square: &#8220;Mostly injuries on people&#8217;s heads, rock-throwing injuries. A few people seem to have received either heavy blows or rocks to their upper body or their arms, that is what we have seen so far. I have seen a few people being carried on stretchers.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1904</strong>The BBC&#8217;s Rupert Wingfield-Hayes says: &#8220;Heliopolis is not like the rest of Cairo. It has grand houses and leafy boulevards. Here the police are still welcomed on the streets. This is the home of Egypt&#8217;s ruling elite &#8211; people like Dr Magid Boutros &#8211; a close adviser to Mr Mubarak. He says the president is now determined to stand and fight: &#8216;He&#8217;s an army man. Military commanders, if they abandon their posts, they are shot.&#8217; Outside on the street I was confronted by members of Egypt&#8217;s ruling class &#8211; educated, articulate and angry. As we returned from Heliopolis our car was forced of the road by another group of angry men. They handed us over to the dreaded Mukhabarat &#8211; the secret police in their brown leather jackets. We were handcuffed and blindfolded and taken to an interrogation cell. Three hours later we were released onto a remote backstreet. The regime is hardening its attitude to the protestors and to the foreign media. Egypt&#8217;s ruling class is fighting back.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1900</strong>A close adviser to President Hosni Mubarak has told the BBC that the president is determined to &#8220;tough it out&#8221;, and will not give in to demands that he step down immediately. He was speaking to our correspondent, Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, who went to the wealthy Cairo suburb of Heliopolis to meet him &#8211; and was then detained by Egypt&#8217;s secret police.</p>

<p><strong>1854</strong>The Egyptian Commission on Human Rights has been meeting to discuss the situation in Cairo. Its president, former UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali, has told the BBC that it wants an investigation into the deaths of anti-government protesters. &#8220;We are asking that an inquiry must be done and must be clearly done to know what was behind this crisis, what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1850</strong>The White House Correspondents&#8217; Association has criticised US President Barack Obama for providing too little information and access to the media during the crisis in Egypt. &#8220;Prior to the president&#8217;s statement Tuesday night, the press corps had not received a substantive update from the White House all day on the situation in Egypt,&#8221; a letter says. &#8220;In addition, the press corps did not have an on-camera briefing, or an off-camera gaggle, with you yesterday to ask the White House about its decision-making process during this major foreign policy crisis.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>1816</strong>A senior US official tells the Reuters news agency that the violence on the streets of Cairo has triggered a debate within President Mubarak&#8217;s inner circle about whether he needs to do more to meet the demands of the protesters.</p>
<p><strong>1811</strong>BBC world affairs editor John Simpson, in Cairo, says: &#8220;Within the last half hour, the heavy battle outside the Egyptian museum between pro- and anti-government demonstrators has ended. Rather unexpectedly, the confrontation seems to have been won by the pro-democracy protesters. All through the day they have been under attack by supporters of President Mubarak, and this represents an important turnaround in the situation. The opposition has now regained control of Tahrir Square, the centre of the last nine days of protests.&#8221;</p>

The United States denounces these attacks and calls on all engaged in demonstrations currently taking place in Egypt to do so peacefully. These attacks are not only dangerous to Egypt; they are a direct threat to the aspirations of the Egyptian people. The use of violence to intimidate the Egyptian people must stop.

<p>&#8220;Obama&#8217;s strength has also been his profound weakness vis-a-vis Egypt. He has been cautious to a fault. Consequently, he and his administration have consistently been behind the curve, surprised by events, and caught flatfooted by the trajectory of history.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1724</strong>The BBC&#8217;s Paul Danahar in Cairo says: &#8220;Much of the fighting is now going on outside Tahrir square. Molotov cocktails and broken paving stones are being thrown.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1722</strong>The BBC&#8217;s Wyre Davies in Alexandria says: &#8220;The curfew is being very strictly enforced in Egypt&#8217;s second city. But after thousands of anti-government protesters gathered in the main square on Tuesday, it still has the feel of a city where most want the president to step down immediately. Perhaps emboldened by the scenes in Tahrir Square, small groups of pro-government demonstrators have been out on the streets, interestingly supported by police vehicles. The Mubarak supporters even stuck their heads above the parapet in the main square.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1714</strong>Wael Nawara, secretary-general of opposition Ghad party, tells the BBC: &#8220;Whatever sympathy [President Mubarak] had from us yesterday, I think this sympathy has totally dried up.

<p><strong>1706</strong>BBC world affairs editor John Simpson, in Tahrir Square, says: &#8220;The stand-off in Tahrir Square seems to be approaching a critical moment. Pro-Mubarak groups, determined and aggressive, have been pushing their way to the edges of Tahrir Square all afternoon. Soldiers, controlling the entrances to the square, have mostly stopped them going further in. But fights have been breaking out and large numbers of missiles &#8211; bricks, stones and bits of ironwork, have been flying through the air on both sides. There are too few soldiers here to keep any kind of order. The most they can do is prevent the big numbers of Mubarak loyalists from getting into the square, bottling them up into huge groups on the edges. The net effect of the arrival in force of groups of Mubarak supporters seems to have been to strengthen the resolve of the hard-line demonstrators to stay inside the square. The gradual drift away from the square seems to have stopped. For now, it is the only place where the demonstrators can feel more or less safe.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1702</strong>Azza, one of the anti-government protesters in Tahrir Square, tells the BBC that she has seen many injured people. &#8220;Lots of people are covered in blood. Lots of people [have broken bones]. They are throwing lots of big, big, big stones.&#8221;</p>

<p>that it is the &#8220;most remarkable regional uprising&#8221; he can remember, adding: &#8220;The US has an overwhelmingly powerful role there. Egypt is the second largest recipient of US military and economic aid. Obama himself has been highly supportive of Mubarak&#8230; This is one of the most brutal dictators of the region.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1656</strong>The BBC&#8217;s Magdi Abdelhadi in Cairo says: &#8220;It is virtually impossible to know the extent of support for Mr Mubarak in Egyptian society. Throughout his long time in office there have never been free and fair elections by international standards and opinion polls designed to measure the president&#8217;s popularity are banned. This leaves most people with guesstimates. There is no doubt, however, that there is a genuine Mubarak constituency &#8211; those who stand to lose influence or money. What complicates the picture further is that there is a tradition of paying the poor and the not so politically aware to come out and demonstrate or vote. There is also what you may call the emotional constituency &#8211; equally difficult to quantify. In a conservative patriarchal culture like Egypt, there will be those who see Mr Mubarak as a father figure and will mourn his demise. One young man told me it was unacceptable to humiliate a man of his age, let alone the father of a nation.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1653</strong>The Swedish newspaper, Aftonbladet, has also said that two of its reporters were attacked by an angry mob in a poor area of Cairo, and then detained by soldiers for several hours.

But there is no indication that there is a fire inside the world-famous institution, which was damaged by looters on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>1610</strong>Two petrol bombs have landed inside the grounds of the Egyptian Museum, near where pro- and anti-government demonstrators have been involved in violent clashes, according to the AFP news agency.</p>
<p><strong>1604</strong>Witnesses tell BBC Arabic that the camels and horses that charged anti-government demonstrators in Tahrir Square earlier belonged to people who work at the Pyramids in Giza. They were apparently angry that the unrest was driving away tourists from Cairo and hurting their businesses.</p>

They have been preparing all sorts of weapons &#8211; pulling down iron railings, breaking up paving stones &#8211; and using them against anti-government protesters. There has been a kind of counter-attack by the pro-Mubarak groups, who are determined to force the remaining protesters out of the square. The soldiers are right here, sitting on their tanks, looking on and occasionally taking shelter, but are not trying to intervene. People know the army is not going to fire on either side, so their presence is not intimidating. The Mubarak supporters are forcing their way into the square through all the main entrances, and trying to force out the protesters gathered there.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>1309</strong>Men on horses and camels have entered Tahrir Square in Cairo, as clashes again break out in Tahrir Square.</p>
<p><strong>1302</strong>Latest pictures from Tahrir Square appear to show violence has now subsided.</p>
<p><strong>1300</strong>Egyptian journalist Nadia el-Awaddy, at Tahrir Square, tells the BBC that tear gas was used during clashes between rival sets of protesters.</p>
<p><strong>1258</strong>The BBC&#8217;s security correspondent Frank Gardner says: &#8220;A few days ago it looked like Hosni Mubarak was going to be the next Arab leader driven out of office. This no longer looks to be the case. This is going to be taken in by other Arab leaders, who are recalibrating their responses. So this is not quite the spectacular revolution the protesters were hoping for.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1257</strong>British officials say nationals wanting to leave Egypt will have to pay £300 for a seat on one of the charter flights laid on by the government.</p>
<p><strong>1251</strong>Dubai&#8217;s al-Arabiya TV says pro-Mubarak protesters have assaulted one of their reporting crews and destroyed their equipment.</p>
<p><strong>1249</strong>Reuters says the protesters involved in clashes in Tahrir Square were using stones and sticks, and about 10 people at the scene were wounded.</p>
<p><strong>1236</strong>More from the BBC&#8217;s Jim Muir: &#8220;It&#8217;s not clear how much violence is happening, but projectiles have been thrown. There is a huge potential for conflict. The army had previously succeeded in keeping Mubarak supporters away from the square, but the army lines appear to have been breeched.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1235</strong>The BBC&#8217;s Jim Muir in Tahrir Square confirms that clashes are going on between opposition protesters and pro-Mubarak groups.</p>
<p><strong>1231</strong>Al-Jazeera TV broadcasts pictures of running battles in Tahrir Square, backing up earlier AFP report (see 1227).</p>

<p><strong>1227</strong>Opposition protesters tell AFP news agency that undercover police have stormed their protest in Tahrir Square.</p>
<p><strong>1225</strong>Egypt Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki defends Mr Mubarak&#8217;s decision to hold on to power until September, telling the BBC: &#8220;There is a keenness to avoid any constitutional anarchy if any president leaves office before the end of his mandate. He has to fulfil his mandate and follow the constitutional process.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1221</strong>The BBC&#8217;s Lina Sinjab reports from Yemen that the opposition there do not appear satisfied with President Saleh&#8217;s announcement that he won&#8217;t run again in 2013. They want to see concrete reforms delivered on the ground, she says.</p>

British Prime Minister David Cameron says transition must be &#8220;rapid and credible and needs to start now&#8221;. Germany&#8217;s Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also called for a rapid transition, welcoming the opening to a &#8220;new political beginning&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>1139</strong>The BBC&#8217;s Magdi Abdelhadi reports from Cairo that the next battle will dismantling the regime, and this will prove easier said than done. Those with vested interests will defend themselves. Where the army stands in all this is crucial.</p>
<p><strong>1134</strong>From the BBC&#8217;s Mark Georgiou in Cairo: &#8220;Massive pro-Mubarak demo in Cairo. People very, very worked up, time and again we were told foreign media is not being fair and the people say that, now the president is not standing for election, it&#8217;s time to restore order. Lots of anti-ElBaradei feeling. It&#8217;s not as simple as just the people in Tahrir Square.</p>
<p><strong>1130</strong>The protesters, who represent a broad section of Egyptian society, would of course disagree with Mr Abdellah &#8211; as would the Muslim Brotherhood, the country&#8217;s largest opposition movement. Many observers have pointed out that the protests in Tunisia, Egypt and beyond could be a hugely positive development for the Arab world, leading to greater freedom and democracy.</p>
<p><strong>1127</strong>Mr Abdellah also had this stark warning for the West: &#8220;You in the West will be the first to pay the price if Egypt falls into the hands of Islamic extremists &#8211; you will pay the price! You will be the first to pay the price! Peace and stability in the Middle East will blow up!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1126</strong>Mohamed Abdellah, former head of the Egyptian parliament&#8217;s foreign affairs committee and now president of Alexandria University, has given the BBC World Service this stinging attack on anti-Mubarak protesters. &#8220;Those people wanted to go to Luxor and to go to the Cairo museum and destroy it. Do you believe that they are peaceful protesters? When you go into hospitals, to destroy hospitals; those are looters!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1119</strong>Egyptian political analyst Mamoun Fandy tells BBC News Channel that the army is protecting both the protesters and President Mubarak&#8217;s regime. It has called on people to go home, but is not ordering them to do so. At the same time, the army doesn&#8217;t want to break the backbone of the Egyptian state by having even bigger protests, like the one called for Friday.</p>
<p><strong>1114</strong> Wyre Davies also reports that there are long queues at banks in Alexandria as people try to withdraw money, as well as huge lines for petrol and basic goods.</p>
<p><strong>1109</strong> In Alexandria, Egypt&#8217;s second city, the BBC&#8217;s Wyre Davies reports that tension is rising. Some pro-Mubarak demonstrators are on the streets, with many thinking the president has now done enough to satisfy the protesters. They have been out in small groups shouting that enough damage has been done to Egypt&#8217;s reputation, and that anti-government protesters should go home.</p>
<p><strong>1057</strong>A fuller quote from that army statement earlier: &#8220;We have to look forward to the future. We have to think about our country, Egypt. The army and the people overcame defeat in October 1973, the army and the people can change the current situation through chivalry, determination and courage. You message was delivered. Your demands are now known, and we are vigilant to keep the country secure for your sake, honourable Egyptians. We have to heed our country&#8217;s call through hard and fruitful work. We have to deny the haters the sight of us in the midst of crises.&#8221;</p>

Food prices, specifically wheat in particular, which is the staple of the Egyptian diet, have gone up, depending on the measure, between 50 and 70% in 2010. This has just devastated Egyptian budgets.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>0758</strong>President Saleh&#8217;s term ends in 2013, so he has a bit more time to ease himself out of office than President Mubarak. Mr Saleh came to power in 1978, first as president of North Yemen and then, after unification with South Yemen in 1990, as leader of the newly united republic. He&#8217;d already signalled in recent months that he might not stand again.</p>
<p><strong>0752</strong>Yemen is one of the countries that have seen demonstrations inspired by the &#8220;Jasmine Revolution&#8221; in Tunisia, which put an abrupt end to the rule of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali last month. Jordan and Algeria have also seen protests.</p>

Among this hardcore of demonstrators prepared to brave the night time cold, there was a very strong view that President Mubarak had not gone far enough. They want to see him deposed and punished.</p>
<p><strong>0728</strong>And US President Obama responded to Mr Mubarak&#8217;s speech by saying that any orderly transition must be meaningful, peaceful &#8211; and begin now.</p>
<p><strong>0727</strong>Let&#8217;s remember that before the President Mubarak made his speech last night, the man who has emerged as Egypt&#8217;s main opposition figure, Mohamed ElBaradei, demanded that Mr Mubarak step down by Friday at the latest.</p>
<p><strong>0725</strong>The BBC&#8217;s Jon Leyne in Cairo says President Mubarak is gambling that enough ordinary Egyptians will accept his decision to stay on until the autumn elections. Mr Mubarak is said to have told a friend that he has a PhD in obstinacy, he says. But our correspondent adds that we should never underestimate the anger and impatience that has built up during the recent demonstrations.</p>
<p><strong>0720</strong>Welcome to the BBC&#8217;s live coverage of unrest on Egypt, where President Hosni Mubarak has announced he won&#8217;t stand in elections in September. The pledge followed unprecedented mass demonstrations against his 30-year rule.

标  题: 火车站手机拍个照差点儿被拘留，同学们引以为鉴<br />
发信站: 北大未名站 (2011年01月23日23:08:31 星期天), 站内信件</p>
<p>地点：天津站<br />
当事人：本人、某警察大叔、某便衣叔叔<br />
事件始末：<br />
从天津坐火车，检票进站后却被警察拦住不准上车，也不说为什么，就拦着大家，说等会<br />
儿才能上。然后举目忘了一下，发现站台上沿着一步电梯到软卧车厢之间被隔离出了一条<br />
大道。。。顿悟！应该是所谓的“交通管制”之类吧！果不其然，在等了数分钟后，一些<br />
衣冠楚楚的领导们从电梯上徐徐走下。。。。<br />
站台上，一边是趾高气扬的领导们，一边是像我这样提着行李在寒风中等待的普通乘客。<br />
观此情景顿感很“中国”，于是下意识的想拍一张。。。。<br />
结果，手机刚拿出来，就有一位警察大叔冲过来冲我喊：你拍什么拍，把手机给我。。。<br />
另外一个便衣叔叔也走过来了，让我先别走了，把手机交给他们，再跟他们走一趟。。。<br />
第一次跟警察交手，有点儿怕怕！于是把手机交给他们检查，然后主动要求检查学生证，<br />
以证明我是良民，只是头脑发热拍着玩儿而已。。。<br />
结果那个警察大叔看都不看我一眼，就说看什么都没用，你就别想走了。。。<br />
插播一下：1.我就在小角落，而且拍的时候领导们是背对着我的，所以应该没有对领导们<br />
通行造成影响。<br />
2.本人女生，一点儿都不魁梧，行凶的话估计有难度。<br />
我试图继续解释，大叔不听。。。而且态度很恶劣，从开始一直都是对我用吼的<br />
看着火车马上就要开了，非常着急，火一下就上来了，于是对着大叔喊到：同志请问您是<br />
要拘留我吗？请问我做了什么违法行为，您根据那条法律规定拘留我呢？<br />
警察大叔：说什么都没用，你别想走。<br />
看我有点儿激动再加上周围开始有人围观，便衣叔叔过来问我哪个学校的，让我把学生证<br />
给他看看。<br />
发现我是北大法学院的，便衣叔叔态度马上有了转变，给了警察大叔一个眼神，貌似准备<br />
放我走了。但没想到那位大叔十分不给面子，反而很火的拿着我的学生证批评我说：“还<br />
学法律的，我看你根本就不懂法，就算是记者在这儿拍照也要经过我们允许，是你想拍就<br />
拍的吗？太不懂规矩了，还学法律的呢。。。。。。<br />
话说士可杀不可辱，我可以不上那辆破车，但是不能任由他颠倒黑白。也不知哪里的胆子<br />
，居然大声的跟他吼上了，有点儿激动，可能有点儿语无伦次，但是内容大概就是：<br />
第一：火车站是公共场所，并不是什么保密机关，我完全有权利拿手机拍个照。<br />
第二：就算是特殊情况不许拍照，也应该事先告知，或者事后善意提醒，他并没有权利就<br />
因为这个拘留我。<br />
第三：如果我违反了那条我“不懂”的法律，请他明确告知，如果他讲得出来他可以把我<br />
押走。<br />
本来以为这样他应该没话说了，让我暴汗的是，那个警察大叔居然说：就是公共场所我才<br />
能管，什么叫公共场所，公共场所就是不准你乱来！<br />
我暴汗，我掏个手机我怎么就乱来了？再说那批领导也没见着电视上露过脸儿的啊！而且<br />
就数目来讲，那么多人，也不太可能都是太高级别的！让他们先上车我就忍了，不至于我<br />
拿个手机出来就得被带去警察局拷问吧？当然，这些我都没说出来，只是心里这么觉得。<br />
觉着说理没用，我用目光向便衣叔叔求助<br />
插播一下：这个便衣叔叔看起来还有点儿修养，查学生证的时候态度很好。<br />
便衣叔叔又向警服示意，警服还是不给面子。不知道我当时脑子抽了还是怎么的，居然说<br />
了一句：同志你哪个单位的，我记下你警号了。。。不说还好，一说这警服一下就激动了<br />
：“你要记警号是吧？跟我回去记！”然后就拽住我的手准备拖我走，说实话当时真的被<br />
吓到了，居然学着电影里超大声喊了一句：“警察打人了！”，结果把车上的人都招下来<br />
了，在此感谢围观的群众们，当时我能看到警服鼻子都快气歪了，指着我说：你再敢大声<br />
喊！但是手却松开了。这是便衣叔叔赶紧把学生证还给我，示意我上车，还很慈爱的提醒<br />
我说：你这孩子太不懂事了，你学的那些法律在这都不管用的。<br />
于是，我在火车开车的最后一秒进了车门，在门口还听到那警服说了一句：还北大的，就<br />
这素质。。。<br />
我一路在车上想了很久，是我素质很差吗？可能是吧！便衣叔叔说得对，是我太不懂事，<br />
所谓人身自由只是宪法里有的，所谓依法行政只是新闻联播里有的，事实上是没有的。文<br />
字的法律跟现实的规则是不同的，那个警服说得很对，我的确不懂他所信仰的那个“法”<br />
。我是个法盲，因为在面对非法扣留时，解救我的并不是法律抗辩，而是一句“警察打人<br />
了”。虽然喊过这句话后我觉得自己像个泼妇，甚至有些汗颜，但是我并不后悔，因为他<br />
放手了，这证明其实他知道作为一个警察，怎样的行为是不应该的。另外就是再次感谢围<br />
观的群众，不管他们出于什么目的，常说“围观改变中国”，我总算是看到了一次正面效<br />
应。我希望下次如果城管再敢掀翻老大爷的摊位时，周围的群众不要漠然的走开，而是强<br />
势的围观。有设备的童鞋一定要录下来，当然，不要像我这样被抓到啦！<br />
总之，虽然第一次遇到了传说中的“暴力执法”，但是感触很多，在此发帖抒发一下，希<br />
望同学们引以为鉴，下次遇到这种情况一定乖乖的等，或者悄悄拍。。。。<br />
我不敢想，如果没有那张大学生的学生证，如果我只说一个农民工，那会是怎样？</p>
